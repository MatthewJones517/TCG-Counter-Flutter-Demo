# TCG Counter
This is a small demo app I wrote to familiarize myself with Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework. It keeps track of your life when playing games such as Magic the Gathering, Exceed, etc... 


## Features

- Change default starting score.
- Add secondary counters (for things like poison damage).
- Change player color themes.
- Mirror player profiles (so two players can use the same phone).

## Download
Download TCG Counter on the [Android App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phonegap.tcgcounter&hl=en_US).
